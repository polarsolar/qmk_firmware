# polarsolar's Zlant layout

Sorry, this is still a mess and does NOT compile. Please ignore.

My first 40% keyboard. Okay, that's not exactly true: I don't have the PCB yet. :) I ignored the Planck-style default layout to put this together and instead prioritized retention of muscle memory for "standard" keyboards & reduction of keystroke errors upon switching back to a standard keyboard. That is, double-tap on Shift, which is mapped to Raise here, won't be disastrous on any 60%+ keyboards. Also, I've preserved the split-spacebar layout of my other boards here.

The Qwerty layout is a direct re-mapping of the Dvorak layer and is only intended for use as a "Dvorak" keyboard when the OS is set to
Dvorak. I wouldn't vouch for it as a legit Qwerty layer due to the positioning of many of the punctuation marks and symbols.
