# polarsolar's Zlant layout

My first 40% keyboard. I ignored the Planck-style default layout to
put this together and instead prioritized retention of muscle
memory for "standard" keyboards & reduction of keystroke errors upon
switching back to a standard keyboard. That is, double-tap on Shift,
which is mapped to Raise here, won't be disastrous on any of my 60%+
keyboards. Also, I've preserved the split-spacebar layout of my other
boards here.

The Qwerty layout is a direct re-mapping of the Dvorak layer and is
only intended for use as a "Dvorak" keyboard when the OS is set to
Dvorak. I wouldn't vouch for it as a legit Qwerty layer due to the
positioning of many of the punctuation marks and symbols.
